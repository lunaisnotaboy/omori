# Omori

A work-in-progress conversion of Omori's RPG Maker MV engine from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Why?

I've been meaning to do this for a while. It's a pain to develop plugins for RPG Maker MV because of the subpar JSDoc comments, so I figured I'd convert the entire thing into TypeScript so that I can base other RPG Maker MV games off of this TypeScript port.

Plus, I didn't really have anything better to do, so...
